## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# HIGH END SIMPLIFICATION
There is no such thing as authentication. You are free to make all the mess you wish to make ;-)

# DATABASE:
Every table has a primary key like this: *id_table_name*.  Won't be listed in columns below, yet it must be physically present.
Every table is named as follows:  
**Weight Progress = weight_progress**


Please provide tables as follows.

## Athlete
This represents the person whose progress are to be monitored. 
* name
* surename
* dob

## Weight Progress
This Represents the variation of the weight of the athlete. Useful if there's diet going on.
* is_first_measurement
* date
* id_athlete (FK)
* amount
* measure_unit

## Discipline
This represents the discipline the athlete wishes to pursue, eg. swimming, weight lifting, calistenics, etc..
* name

## Exercise
This represents the single exercise, specific for the discipline, eg, 4 x 50m crawl style, 3 x 15 lower abs, 4 bar tractions, etc..

**Please note:** an exercise is read as follows: 4 *repetitions (of)* 50m *single shot measure*  crawl style *(the exercise name)* , hence:
* name 
* single_shot_measure
* repetitions
* measure_unit
* effort_scale

the *measure_unit* may vary, but the idea is that is works in these situations:  
* 50 *metres* crawl
* 3 x 5 25 *kilograms* lifting
* 15 lower abs lift  (no measure needed)

the *effort* is meant to give an index of difficulty. Totally optional, and in your db you may wanna give it a default value of 1.

# Athlete Exercise 
Meant to track the exercise practiced by an athlete. 
* id_athlete
* id_exercise
* date
* completed
